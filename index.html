        <h1>DISCOVER THE MAPS OF THE APEX GAMES</h1>
        <p>Kings Canyon, World’s Edge, and Olympus. You’ve fought there, you’ve died there, but do you know why they were chosen? Hammond Robotics and the Mercenary Syndicate seem to have a hand in everything that shapes the destiny of the Outlands... Learn more about the maps that host the Apex Games.</p>

        <h1>Olympus</h1>
        <p>Olympus was a city built on dreams. A utopia floating in clouds above Psamathe, it was once a place where the brightest minds in the Outlands could gather and exchange ideas, leading to breakthroughs in the sciences and arts. However, all dreams come to an end, and this one ended explosively: an accident in an experimental research facility led to the creation of the Phase Rift (a massive bubble of Phase energy), and the Outlands’ best and brightest quickly abandoned the city.</p>
    <p>However, Olympus itself was maintained by advanced computer systems, so it quickly found new buyers in the Outlands’ elite. For 40 years, it served as a lavish vacation spot with the Rift as a tourist attraction. Unfortunately, the Rift grew unstable overtime, and Olympus was fully evacuated six months ago. Now Hammond Robotics, with the support of the Mercenary Syndicate, has transformed Olympus into a new stage for the Apex Games – though why is anyone’s guess.</p>

    <section id="Worlds_Edge">
        <img src="https://media.contentapi.ea.com/content/dam/apex-legends/common/maps-page/apex-embed-image-maps-hub-worlds-edge.jpg" alt="">
        <h1>World's Edge</h1>
        <p>A harsh planet beset by intense volcanic activity, Talos was once deemed uninhabitable, and only small luddite settlements took root there. However, it became a hotbed of IMC activity when a rare mineral compound was discovered beneath its surface. Heat-reducing towers were built to super-cool its natural lava flows to allow resource extraction - the facility that housed them was optimistically dubbed “New Dawn”, and the town of World’s Edge grew around it.</p>
        <p>Decades ago, an explosion in one of the towers covered the surrounding area in a lethal flash freeze. World’s Edge was abandoned, its only remaining inhabitants a small community of hunters who once spurned modern technology (but tentatively accepted it again under the guidance of their beloved local hero, Bloodhound). However, its ruins and the planet’s energy-rich soil drew the attention of two critical groups: the Mercenary Syndicate and Hammond Robotics. Today, World’s Edge is the second home of the Apex Games and a key operational center for Hammond Robotics, who installed the latest in modern mining technology - the Planet Harvester - to begin their own resource extraction.

        <h1>Kings Canyon</h1>
       <p>Once a simple settlement on the planet Solace, the island known as Kings Canyon didn't thrive until the IMC chose it as a hub for research and development. It housed an airbase, a water treatment plant, and a plethora of other facilities to support the IMC’s operations - operations like a highly classified project on the function of Phase tech, or a radical program to create a simulacra army powered by a single brain. But on the surface, Kings Canyon seemed like a simple IMC installation that, for all its faults, brought stability and jobs to Solace.</p>
        <p>To blow off steam, IMC soldiers stationed here would compete in gladiator-esque combat in an area they nicknamed 'Thunderdome'. Years later, when the Syndicate chose Kings Canyon as the site of their newest bloodsport, Thunderdome remained untouched - a tribute to the earliest known predecessor of the Apex Games. The island has undergone many changes since then - the Repulsor Tower was brought down by an unknown assailant, an explosion in an abandoned simulacra facility caused Thunderdome and Skulltown to collapse, and much of the island has been excavated under the watchful eye of the Syndicate. But no matter how it changes, it will always be the first home of the Apex Games.</p>

    <h1>Cross-play</h1>
    <section class="first">
        <h1>What platforms are supported?</h1>
        <p>Players will be able to party up and play together across all currently supported platforms:  PlayStation®4, PlayStation®5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and Origin and Steam for PC.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="second">
        <h1>How do I enable cross-play?</h1>
        <p>Cross-platform play is enabled by default. Unless you’ve changed it, you should be good to go! Xbox One also contains a similar setting in the system settings, outside of the game, that must be enabled.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="third">
        <h1>How do I play with friends on other platforms?</h1>
        <p>To add a friend on any platform, go to the Friends Menu and click “Find Friend”. You’ll be able to search for a username on any platform and initiate a friend request.</p>
        <p>The invited user will receive a notification in the lobby to accept, reject, or block the incoming friend request. Blocking a friend request will not only reject the request, but also prevent you from seeing additional cross-play invitations or requests in the future from that user. You can find and unblock users from inside the find friends menu.</p>
        <p>You can view all friends in the Friends Menu and which platform they’re on, indicated with a platform icon. If you’re on a console, friends on the same platform will be marked with a PlayStation®, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox icon depending which platform you’re on, and players on the other brand console will be indicated by a generic gamepad icon.</p>
        <p>Once friends, you can initiate a game invite via the friends menu. For cross-platform party invites, the party invitation will appear in the lobby screen and allow you to join the party. Same platform party invites will continue to use the default notifications as before, ie Origin game invites, or Xbox notification.</p>
        <p>Cross platform parties can use in-game voice chat.</p>
